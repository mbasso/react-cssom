### Building

#### Building react-cssom

Running the `build` task will create both a CommonJS module-per-module build and a UMD build.
```
npm run build
```

To create just a CommonJS module-per-module build:

```
npm run build:commonjs

```

The result will be in the `lib` folder.

To create just a UMD build:
```
npm run build:umd
npm run build:umd:min
```

The result will be in the `dist` folder.

### Testing and Linting

To run both linting and testing at once, run the following:

```
npm run check:src
```

To only run linting:

```
npm run lint
```

To only run tests:

```
npm run test
```

To continuously watch and run tests, run the following:

```
npm run test:watch
```
